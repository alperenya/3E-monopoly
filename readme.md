### Game
	Monopoly
	
### Game Theme
	Covid-19
	
### Planned Programming Language
	Java

#### General Stance of Game
The game will follow the basic rules of the monopoly with a few twists that will challenge the players.
In the original monopoly, the players aim to establish a monopoly in the economy but in this specific implementation, the players
will have to face real-world economic problems which are caused by the Covid-19 to establish their dominance over the economy.

#### Changed / Added Game Rules
	1. Players will face a penalty if they ever land on slots which are next to other players due to violation of social distancing rule.
	2. The jail slot is now changed with a quarantine slot that affects player's infection level which is explained later in the document.
	3. Each of the slots will have different and random corona risk levels that may cause players to go into quarantine. 
	4. The game slots will now contain random loots that will help the players in their way to become monopoly (the first one to land on it gets the loot). After the retrieval of the loot, new ones will emerge if not the same loot stays in the same spot.
	5. Instead of the "Free Parking" slot, a "Free Test Center" will be added to check the player's current infection status. If the player is infected,
they go to quarantine, if not they are rewarded for being a responsible citizen.
	6. The game map could be altered in a way that offers the players to choose their path instead of going in circles.
	7. The "Chance" and "Community Chest" spots will remain the same but the cards will be redesigned according to the Covid-19 theme.
	8. Each player will have individual infection risk levels that will rise during the gameplay. If the player lands on a hotspot, his/her level will increase
that may cause the player into going into quarantine.
